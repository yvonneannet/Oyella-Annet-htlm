    <img style=" width: 400px ;" src="Yvonne.jpg" alt=""> <p style=" font-size: 20px;">Hello, my name is Oyella Annet Eyvone.<br> My first week at Akirachix was both  exciting and daunting. <br>I was relieved that I had finally made it to the campus, while being scared of what to expect from the coming days. I also got introduced to new things and had some time to quikly adjust to the new environment also to the way activities were run. </p>
<h2 style="color: darkblue;font-style: italic;font-size: large;">Positive Experience </h2>
<ol>
        <div style="font-size: 20px;"></style>
    <li>I loved how the allumni and the other staff I got to meet were welcoming, this helped calm my already tense nerves.</li>
    <li>The pep talk that was offered by our different allumni in charge of our rooms helped give us direction on how things were run in this campus.</li>
    <li>The housekeepers were also so warm and welcoming.</li>
    <li>I loved the whole atmosphere of the place, it was calm and one could alwys have the feel of having a warm away from home experience.</li></div>
</ol>
<h3 style="color: darkblue;font-style: italic;font-size:large;">Negative Experience</h3>
<ul> 
    <div style="font-size: 20px;"></style>
        <li>My tummy has been hurting since the second day I reported. </li>
        <li>In the first week I had issues with having to clean after people before I could get to use the toilet.</li>
        <li>The was no known schedule or timetable in the initial days so it all left me confused on what activity was meant to be done during a specific time. </li></div>
